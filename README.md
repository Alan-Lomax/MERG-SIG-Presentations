# MERG-SIG-Presentations
MERG Arduino SIG Presentations (Work in Progress)

This is a collection point for collaboration and development of presentations. The presentations are intended for the use of the MERG Arduino SIG. It is expected that there may be a series of presentations when all is said and done. This Readme is intended to be used to capture the proposed outline:

## Part 0:
<LI> General Presentation Style and Go-By PowerPoint Template

## Part 1:
<LI> The environment (IDE)
<LI> (perhaps a sidebar discussion on knowing your hardware - differences / similarities pins and pin capabilities etc)
<LI> Loading a Program / Installing a Library
<LI> Examine an 'Example' discussing the structure
<LI> Writing your first program / Testing and Debugging Techniques

## Part 2:
<LI>  Variable types
<LI>  General programming topics (loops, conditionals, functions etc)
<LI>  Good style vs poor style
  
## Part 3:
<LI>  Programming without delay()
<LI>  Hardware Shields etc  (Servos, Sensors, Motor Control)
  
## Part 4:
<LI>  Structures
<LI>  Classes
  
## Part 5:
<LI>  Advanced Topics
