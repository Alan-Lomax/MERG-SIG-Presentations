## Ground Up presentation
<li> Is a scoping study / discussion document for a possible carrier board for an Arduino NANO and I/O
<li> Could use as a basis for an educational video series (hardware and software)
<li> Would be a very usable device in its own right as a 'standard construction block for model railway Arduinos'
<li> Is simple to use for hardware integration onto practically any layout or as a development platform
<li> Has various pin header interfaces (sensors, servos and comms) available to use
