# MERG-SIG-Presentations
MERG Arduino SIG Presentations (Work in Progress)

This is a collection point for collaboration and development of presentations. The presentations are intended for the use of the MERG Arduino SIG. It is expected that there may be a series of presentations when all is said and done. This Readme is intended to be used to capture the proposed outline:

## Part 0:
<LI> General Presentation Style and Go-By which may save you time fussing. (Completely optional and by no means a requirement)

## Part 1:
<LI> The environment (IDE)
<LI> > Download + Install and Quick Overview of Menus with references for additional help (lots out there)
<LI> > Establish a connection to an Arduino - common issues (old driver, knock off, wrong port)
<LI> > A discussion on knowing your hardware understanding what the pinout diagram is telling you. (where to get them)
<LI> > What the acronyms mean with respoect to pins and pin capabilities (PWM, ADC etc)
<LI> Connect USB up ... the factory default 'blink' program and what that is telling you
<LI> Establish a first connection / Loading a Program / Installing a Library
<LI> Examine an 'Example' (eg: blink) discussing the structure setup, loop and the semicolon! change some constants and observe the effects.
<LI> Writing your first program.
<LI> Testing and Debugging Techniques - sprinkling print statements everywhere (Will get to conditional compiling later)
<LI> Leave off with a simple programming challenge (loading an example and modifying it, running it, seeing the output) 

## Part 2:
<LI> Discussion on programming challenge from last time (work it through) (intention here is to demystify, remove any aprehension, build early confidence)
<LI> Variable types void, int, string, char[], float, signed vs unsigned (underneath it is all binary - its how to interprate the patterns)
<LI> General programming topics (loops, conditionals, functions etc)
<LI>  >> Conditional compiling
<LI> Good style vs poor style
<LI> Leave off with a simple programming challenge (write a loop, run it, see the output) 
  
## Part 3:
<LI> Discussion on programming challenge from last time (work it through)
<LI> functions()
<LI> What is delay() and why do we want to avoid it?
<LI> Hardware Shields etc  (Servos, Sensors, Motor Control)
  
## Part 4:
<LI> Structures
<LI> Classes
  
## Part 5:
<LI> Advanced Topics
