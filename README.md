# MERG-SIG-Presentations
MERG Arduino SIG Presentations (Final)

A collection of my MERG presentations. The presentations were in general created for use by the MERG Arduino SIG. 
Some presentations may have started out as club presentations and been repurposed.  
The following outline is a proposed framework from which a curriculum could evolve.

## Part 0:
<LI> General Presentation Style and Go-By. Includes some best practices to consider in any presentation.

## Part 1:
<LI> The environment (IDE)
<LI> Getting Started
<LI> "Hello World"

## Part 2:
<LI> Variable types void, int, string, char[], float, signed vs unsigned (underneath it is all binary - its how to interprate the patterns)
<LI> General programming topics (loops, conditionals, functions etc)
<LI> Topics of Style and Good Practice
<LI> Leave off with a simple programming challenge (write a loop, run it, see the output) 
  
## Part 3:
<LI> Functions()
<LI> Debugging Techniques
<LI> Hardware Shields etc  (Servos, Sensors, Motor Control)
  
## Part 4:
<LI> Structures
<LI> Classes
